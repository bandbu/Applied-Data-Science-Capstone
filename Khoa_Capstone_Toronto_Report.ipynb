By Locating in the general vicinity of the Exact location my friend could be geographically centered in this cluster and poised to service his restaurant customer base with the greatest efficiency.<br>\n",

Really there were 8 types of cluster or neighborhoods in greater Toronto. The vast majority of those were in 0 cluster. So Toronto coffeeshop might be many but they are very homogeneously located near the center or downtown of Toronto.<br>\n",
